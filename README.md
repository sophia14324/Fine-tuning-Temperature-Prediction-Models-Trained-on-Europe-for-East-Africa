# Fine-tuning Temperature Prediction Models Trained on Europe for East-Africa

This project takes a pretrained temperature regression model ie., ERA5 Europe, then fine-tuned on CHIRPS East Africa.

### Focus: 
* Explains what features to freeze, and why youâ€™d use fewer epochs.
* Show how transfer helped compared to training from scratch.
